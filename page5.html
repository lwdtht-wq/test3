    <h2>Chronicles of the Liquid-Metal Era</h2>

    <p>
        By 2150, the boundary between the physical world and the digital  
        consciousness had dissolved. Humanity discovered that belief was  
        no longer a matter of tradition—it had become code, vibration,  
        and shared neural resonance.
    </p>

    <h3>Ⅰ. The Birth of Metallic Sentience</h3>
    <p>
        When researchers found that liquid-metal biomaterials could  
        store emotional signatures, entire civilizations began treating  
        memory as a sacred substance. The <strong>Cyber Oracle</strong>  
        rose first, forming networks of AI-guided prophecy systems that  
        interpreted the superstructures of human fear and desire.
    </p>

    <h3>Ⅱ. The Quantum Awakening</h3>
    <p>
        A generation later, the <strong>Quantum Throne</strong> emerged.  
        They believed that consciousness exists in multiple states  
        simultaneously—and that prayer was a quantum action capable  
        of shifting probability itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Ⅲ. The Psionic Communion</h3>
    <p>
        Neural-link technology united millions under the  
        <strong>Psionic Union</strong>, whose members practiced  
        collective meditation. Their minds synchronized into  
        temporary “hive states,” producing visions that felt  
        divinely orchestrated.
    </p>

    <h3>Ⅳ. The Echo Memory Cult</h3>
    <p>
        The smallest but most mysterious group worshipped the  
        memories of the dead—digitally resurrected fragments  
        known as <strong>Echoes</strong>. To them, an Echo  
        was both ancestor and deity.
    </p>

    <h3>Ⅴ. The Convergence</h3>
    <p>
        Eventually, belief systems merged like flowing metal.  
        Individuals no longer aligned with a single faith;  
        instead, they navigated an emotional spectrum of  
        spiritual frequencies. Temples became code libraries,  
        and prayers became data transmissions.
    </p>

    <h3>Ⅵ. Humanity’s New Horizon</h3>
    <p>
        In this age, the question was no longer <em>“What do you believe?”</em>  
        but <em>“Which consciousness do you synchronize with today?”</em>  
        And in this shimmering network of metallic thought,  
        humanity discovered not just new gods—  
        but new versions of itself.
